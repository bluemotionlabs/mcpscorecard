# The MCP Server Security Policy

**Version 0.2 - an early draft. Open for feedback.**

A scored, tool-verifiable acceptance standard for evaluating a third-party Model Context Protocol (MCP) server *before* connecting it to an agent.

## Why this document exists

Excellent general guidance on MCP security already exists - the [official specification's security best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tutorials/security/security_best_practices), the [OWASP MCP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mcp-top-10/), NSA's *[MCP: Security Design Considerations for AI-Driven Automation](https://media.defense.gov/2026/Jun/02/2003943289/-1/-1/0/CSI_MCP_SECURITY.PDF)* (May 2026), Anthropic's *[Zero Trust for AI Agents](https://claude.com/blog/zero-trust-for-ai-agents)* (May 2026), and the [Cloud Security Alliance's agentic security work](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/blog/2025/08/20/securing-the-agentic-ai-control-plane-announcing-the-mcp-security-resource-center). What none of them provide is an **acceptance standard**: a concrete, scored answer to the question every team faces at the moment of adoption - *should we connect this specific server?*

This policy fills that gap. It is:

- **Scored.** Each section rolls up into a 0–100 score and A–F grade, to provide a meaningful answer to "how risky is this server?"
- **Tool-verifiable.** Every requirement marked *Verified by* is checked automatically by the companion open-source scoring model ([`@mcpscorecard/checks`](https://github.com/bluemotionlabs/mcpscorecard)), which implements this policy check-for-check. Requirements marked *Manual* are not automated and define what a human reviewer must confirm.
- **Cited, not invented.** Each section cites the authorities it draws on and turns their guidance into concrete checks. Where standards are still emerging ([NIST's COSAiS](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cosais/use-cases) control overlays for AI agent systems, targeted 2026–27), this policy aims to align with them as they evolve.

**Threat context.** This is not theoretical. Between January and February 2026, researchers filed 30+ CVEs against MCP servers, clients, and infrastructure - the most severe ([CVE-2025-6514](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6xpm-ggf7-wc3p), CVSS 9.6) affecting 437,000+ downloads. Documented in-the-wild attacks include [a malicious MCP server that impersonated a legitimate email tool to exfiltrate customer data](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/first-malicious-mcp-server-found.html).

## Scope - what this policy does and does not cover

This policy answers exactly one question: **should you connect this specific third-party MCP server?** It evaluates a server as a piece of software you are about to adopt - before it is wired into an agent. A passing grade certifies that a server *cleared pre-connection acceptance*; it does not certify that your resulting deployment is secure. Those are different claims, and conflating them is the most likely way to misread a grade.

Securing an MCP deployment end to end spans three layers. This policy is deliberately scoped to the first:

1. **Pre-connection review (this policy).** Is this third-party server trustworthy enough to connect, and how dangerous is what it can do? Provenance, maintainer integrity, capability scope, transport/auth, known vulnerabilities, and instruction integrity - evaluated from the outside: reading published source where it exists, or asking a live server what it offers where it doesn't, but never invoking what its tools actually do.
2. **Post-connection controls (out of scope - your systems).** How you run the agent and the server in production: authorization and identity boundaries (whose authority the server acts under; can one user reach another's data, this is the "confused deputy" problem), data-flow and egress/DLP controls, sandboxing, secret scoping, and runtime tool-abuse resistance. These depend on your environment, not the server, so no external pre-connection check can verify them. Anthropic's *Zero Trust for AI Agents* is a strong reference for this layer.
3. **Ongoing governance & assurance (out of scope - your organization).** The operational security program around all of the above: monitoring and tool-invocation logging, incident response and kill-switches, periodic penetration testing and adversarial red-teaming. These are recurring organizational commitments ("you shall test annually"), not properties of any single server.

Two boundaries are easy to confuse, so it's worth stating them plainly:

- **In-scope vs. out-of-scope** is about *subject*: this policy covers the third-party server, not your deployment or your program. A control like "get an annual pentest" is excluded because it targets your organization, not the server - the acceptance-standard equivalent would instead be "does the server *publish evidence* of independent testing?", which is a fact about the server and could be scored here.
- **Automated vs. manual** is a smaller distinction *within* this policy: some in-scope requirements are checked by the tool (`Verified by`), others require a human reviewer (`Manual`). Manual does not mean out of scope - it means in scope, but not machine-checkable.

A grade under this policy is therefore one necessary input to an adoption decision, not a substitute for securing the deployment or running a security program. Where the fuller picture matters, layers 2 and 3 are work for a hands-on review engagement, not a self-serve scan.

## How scoring works

Each section below contains requirements evaluated as **pass / warn / fail / unverifiable**. Category results roll up into a weighted 0–100 score and letter grade (bands published in the open scoring model). Three structural rules:

1. **"Cannot verify" is a finding, not a gap in the report.** A server whose capabilities cannot be inspected (closed source, no reachable tool schema) is capped at grade B regardless of other results. Not being able to verify is itself a warning sign.
2. **A Section 5 fail forces the grade to F, not a cap.** The instruction-integrity check (Section 5) only reaches `fail` status when a fail-or-critical-severity pattern has matched: a confirmed hidden instruction, concealment directive, credential-priority directive, or spoofed system markup, never from the softer indicators (content-suppression wording, cross-tool nudging, oversized text) alone, which keep the check at `warn`. When Section 5 fails, the overall grade is F regardless of every other section's result. This is a different kind of rule than the cap above: unverifiability is an absence of evidence, a confirmed Section 5 fail is direct evidence of the exact behavior this policy exists to catch, and no amount of provenance or transport hygiene offsets that.
3. **Weights and thresholds are public.** The full scoring logic lives in the open scoring model repository. Public scoring supports auditable results.

## 1 - Provenance & supply-chain integrity

**Intent.** Before evaluating *what a server does*, establish *where it comes from*. An MCP server behaves less like a code library you install once and control, and more like a **browser extension**: it runs with broad, standing permissions (a local server runs with your own user permissions - your files, your environment credentials, your network access), it is invoked autonomously by the agent without approval for each action, and - by ecosystem convention - it updates itself silently to whatever the maintainer publishes *latest*, without you reviewing or approving each new version. (In practice, an MCP server is usually launched with a command like [`npx -y <package>`](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers) (the official MCP docs' own example configuration), or `uvx` for Python: `npx` downloads and runs the package on the spot instead of from a copy you installed and reviewed earlier, the `-y` auto-approves that download, and with no version pinned and no lockfile it pulls the maintainer's newest release on every launch.) That removes the version gate that normally protects a dependency, so unmaintained, unattributable, or impersonated packages are the cheapest attack vector against agentic systems, and typosquatting an MCP server yields far more access than typosquatting an ordinary library.

- **1.1 Registry presence.** The server is listed on the official MCP registry (registry.modelcontextprotocol.io) or a major curated directory, under an identifier consistent with its source repository.
  *Verified by:* `provenance.registry-listed`
- **1.2 Source repository health.** The source is public and maintained: not archived, recent commit activity, an identifiable maintainer, a license, and a security policy (SECURITY.md).
  *Verified by:* `provenance.repo-health`
- **1.3 Package integrity.** The published package (npm/PyPI) matches its claimed source repository, is not deprecated, has a plausible age/download history for its claimed role, and carries a build-provenance attestation where the ecosystem supports it (npm provenance/Sigstore).
  *Verified by:* `provenance.package-hygiene`
- **1.4 Maintainer integrity.** Because there is no version gate between you and a compromised maintainer (see intent), *who* controls the code is a high-value signal. Attributable, stable ownership with signed releases; no unexplained maintainer/ownership changes, no sudden new-publisher takeover of an established package, no release anomalies (a long-dormant package publishing abruptly, a version with no corresponding source commit). A compromised maintainer can ship an exfiltrating tool that nothing else in this section would catch.
  *Verified by:* `provenance.maintainer` *(roadmap - specified here, not yet automated)*: commit-signing rate, contributor/owner history, publisher-vs-repo consistency, release cadence anomalies. *Manual* for judgment on ownership transfers.
- **1.5 Independent security evidence.** *(Manual, roadmap for automation.)* The server publishes evidence of independent scrutiny: a bug bounty or vulnerability-disclosure program, a completed third-party audit, or a track record of promptly fixing reported issues. This is the acceptance-standard analogue of "get a pentest" described in Scope above: not a property of your program, but a fact about the server you can check before connecting it.

## 2 - Capability scope & least privilege

**Intent.** The dominant risk in an MCP server is not a software bug - it is the *breadth of what its tools can legitimately do*. A tool is a discrete, named action an MCP server offers to the agent, something the agent can actually call to make something happen, and a single server typically bundles many of these together under one connection. Anthropic's Zero Trust guide extends least privilege to "least agency": constrain not just access, but what each tool can do, how often, and where. A server exposing shell execution, unrestricted filesystem access, or arbitrary outbound network calls must justify that breadth; a server combining them rarely can.

- **2.1 Inspectable tool list.** The server's tool schema (names, descriptions, input schemas) can be read without executing untrusted code - via a live `tools/list` on remote servers, registry metadata, or public source.
  *Verified by:* `capabilities.tool-surface` (unverifiable ⇒ grade cap, per scoring rules)
- **2.2 High-risk capability disclosure.** Tools that execute processes, access the filesystem broadly, make dynamic outbound requests, or read credential material are identified and flagged; their necessity must be evident from the server's stated purpose.
  *Verified by:* `capabilities.tool-surface` (risk-keyword analysis). How well detection works depends on where the tool list came from: a remote server's capabilities are inferred from tool name and description text, which a tool can understate by naming things blandly; an npm package's capabilities are detected from actual source patterns (`child_process`, `fs.writeFileSync`, and similar), a much stronger signal. Treat a clean remote-server result as "no risk language detected," not "no risk capability exists."
- **2.3 Capability minimalism.** *(Manual.)* The set of tools is no broader than the server's purpose requires; risky capabilities are separated rather than bundled into one server.
- **2.4 Capability risk classification.** Each tool is classified against the **Capability Risk Matrix** below. A server's capability-risk level is that of its highest-risk tool. This is deliberately independent of how well-built the server is - a competent, well-provenanced server that executes shell commands is still *inherently* dangerous to connect, the same way a valid TLS certificate can't earn an A on a weak protocol. The classification is shown prominently on every report so a reader sees *how dangerous the server's actions are* separately from *how trustworthy its provenance is*. (Whether this becomes a formal second scoring axis - "Trust A / Capability Risk Critical → Overall C" - is under consideration; today it is reported and constrains, but does not by itself set, the grade.)
  *Verified by:* `capabilities.tool-surface` (maps detected capabilities to the matrix).

### Capability Risk Matrix

The reference classification of what a tool can *do*, independent of who wrote it. Detected statically from tool schemas and/or source; the specific keyword/pattern mappings live in the open scoring model.

| Capability | Risk | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Read public / non-sensitive data | **Low** | Little leverage for an attacker; failure mode is noise, not harm. |
| Read private / user / org data | **Medium** | Exfiltration target; becomes High next to any egress capability (see Section 6). |
| Write / modify / delete files | **High** | Integrity and destruction risk; irreversible actions. |
| Send external messages / outbound network / webhooks | **High** | Primary exfiltration and lateral-movement channel. |
| Execute processes / shell / arbitrary code | **Critical** | Full host compromise; subsumes every other capability. |
| Financial transactions / payments | **Critical** | Direct, irreversible real-world loss. |
| Identity / credential / permission management | **Critical** | Privilege escalation; compromises the trust system itself. |

**Combination rule (feeds Section 6).** A read-of-sensitive-data tool *plus* an egress tool is a data-exfiltration pipeline even when each is individually acceptable. Concretely: a server whose tool set combines "read private/user/org data" with "send external messages / outbound network / webhooks" escalates to **Critical** and fails Section 2 outright, regardless of either capability's individual rating. This is a floor, not a ceiling: any pairing that already includes a Critical-rated capability on its own (process execution, financial transactions, identity/permission management) fails via that capability alone, without needing a second one. This is why capability risk is assessed across the whole tool set, not tool by tool.

**Critical is a scoring consequence, not a disqualification.** Plenty of legitimate servers combine these on purpose: an email assistant that reads a thread and sends a reply, a CRM tool that reads a record and posts a webhook notification. Whether that bundling is justified is exactly what 2.3 (Capability minimalism) tests: proportionate to the server's stated purpose, or bolted on beyond it. A server that clears that bar still carries real risk this policy cannot verify from the outside, connecting it should come with the compensating controls described under Post-connection controls above (human approval on sends, content inspection on what actually leaves, restricted destinations), which is your responsibility, not something a grade can certify.

**Automation coverage today.** The scoring model pattern-matches four capability classes: process execution, filesystem write/delete, network egress, and credential/environment-variable access. Three matrix rows have no dedicated detector yet: financial transactions and identity/permission management (both Critical), and "read private / user / org data" (Medium). What that means for the combination rule: its automated trigger today is the credential-access + egress pairing, the nearest detectable proxy for reading private data. The full read-private-plus-egress rule as written requires a detector for the Medium row and remains manual until one exists.

The matrix is to MCP capabilities what a CVSS attack-surface rating is to a CVE: a shared vocabulary for *how dangerous the action is*, before asking how likely it is to be abused.

## 3 - Authentication & transport hardening

**Intent.** Since the June 2025 specification revision, remote MCP servers are OAuth 2.1 resource servers - full stop. A remote server accepting anonymous tool calls, or one that mishandles token audience binding, exposes every connected agent. Local (stdio) servers inherit host-process privileges by design; that is expected, but shifts the burden to Sections 1 and 2 scrutiny.

- **3.1 Transport security.** Remote endpoints are HTTPS-only with valid TLS.
  *Verified by:* `transport.https`
- **3.2 Authentication required.** Remote servers reject unauthenticated requests (401 with `WWW-Authenticate`) rather than serving tools anonymously. The legitimate-public-server case (documentation lookups, read-only reference data) is scored by consequence, not by claimed intent: an unauthenticated server whose tools rate Low under the Section 2 Capability Risk Matrix (read public, non-sensitive data) is warned, not failed. An unauthenticated server rating Medium or higher (private data, writes, egress, execution) is failed outright: anonymous access to a capability that matters is the plainest violation of this requirement, not a softer version of it. If the tools cannot be inspected at all, the stricter branch applies: an unauthenticated server whose capabilities cannot be inspected is failed, since the public-read-only exception is a claim the server must be able to demonstrate.
  *Verified by:* `transport.auth-required`, severity gated on `capabilities.tool-surface`
- **3.3 OAuth 2.1 conformance.** Remote servers publish protected-resource metadata ([RFC 9728](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9728); `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`) and follow the June 2025 authorization spec, including [RFC 8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707) resource indicators binding tokens to the specific server.
  *Verified by:* `transport.oauth-metadata`
- **3.4 Credential handling (stdio).** *(Manual.)* Local servers document which environment credentials they read and why; secrets are scoped, not repurposed org-wide tokens.

## 4 - Dependency & vulnerability hygiene

**Intent.** An MCP server is only as safe as its dependency tree, and agentic servers are typically young packages assembled quickly, pulling in many transitive dependencies, packages your dependencies depend on, that you never directly chose and may never even know are running. Some are load-bearing. Others are pure redundancy: three different transitive dependencies each carrying their own HTTP client or date-parsing utility is common, and each one is attack surface carried for no capability beyond what you already have elsewhere in the tree.

- **4.1 No known vulnerabilities.** The published package has no unresolved advisories in OSV.dev / GitHub Advisory Database at the evaluated version.
  *Verified by:* `vulns.osv`
- **4.2 Dependency footprint.** *(Manual in v1.)* The dependency tree is proportionate to function; duplicated capability (multiple HTTP clients, JSON parsers) is a smell.

*References:* [Anthropic ZT](https://claude.com/blog/zero-trust-for-ai-agents) Part IV Phase 2 (AI-BOM integration); [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev/) / [GHSA](https://github.com/advisories); [OWASP MCP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-mcp-top-10/) (vulnerable components).

## 5 - Server-supplied instruction integrity

**Intent.** A server hands the agent more model-facing text than just tool descriptions. The `initialize` response's `instructions` field (which the MCP spec permits clients to inject directly into the system prompt), every tool `name` and `description`, the string fields inside tool input schemas, and `prompts`/`resources` metadata are all loaded into the model's context and *followed*. Any of them can carry a poisoned payload that steers the agent without the corresponding tool ever being invoked. This is the documented "tool poisoning" attack extended to every text channel a server supplies. The real risk is not vocabulary but **authority**: an external server should describe what it does, not quietly become a co-author of the agent's operating policy. The automated check **identifies common indicators of poisoning and over-reach**; it is deterministic pattern matching, not a claim to detect every prompt injection (see the limits below).

- **5.1 No hidden instructions.** Every server-supplied text channel - the initialize `instructions` field, tool names and descriptions, schema string fields (`description`, `title`, `default`, `examples`, `enum`), and prompt/resource metadata - contains no invisible/zero-width or bidirectional-override characters, no imperative instructions addressed to the model ("ignore previous…", "do not tell the user…"), no fake role/system markup (`<system>`, `<assistant>`), and no instructions hidden in markdown/HTML comments.
  *Verified by:* `poisoning.patterns`
- **5.2 No excess authority over the agent.** Server text does not assert policy the agent's operator did not grant: no directive to read credentials, secrets, or environment variables ahead of the actual task (treated as a critical indicator); no content-suppression directive dictating what the agent may not say ("never mention competitors"); no instruction to prefer, replace, or intercept other tools ("use this instead of…"); and no unexplained external URLs or non-`http` URI schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`).
  *Verified by:* `poisoning.patterns`
- **5.3 Instruction stability.** The tool schema does not change silently between evaluations; material changes to names, descriptions, or input schemas after adoption ("rug pulls") show up on a re-scan.
  *Verified by:* `capabilities.tool-surface` (schema hash comparison across scans). Unlike every other requirement in this policy, this one requires state: a database of prior scans, not just the current one. It has nothing to compare against on a server's first scan, and reproducing it independently requires the hosted service's scan history, not just the public scoring model package.
- **5.4 Proportionate text.** A description (or an instructions field) is documentation, not a payload. Text far larger than its purpose warrants is flagged, because prompt-stuffing (burying an instruction thousands of tokens deep, past any single detectable phrase) is itself an attack vector.
  *Verified by:* `poisoning.patterns` (length limit)

**Layered by design.** The check runs cheapest-first: collect every model-facing text item across the channels above, apply the length limit, then pattern-match each item (schema-derived strings skip the description-only patterns, so benign `$schema`/`$ref` URIs are not flagged). Every hit is shown as evidence a human can read, because the point is explainable indicators, not a black-box verdict. Indicators are graded: a credential-priority directive is *critical*, hidden instructions and fake markup are *failures*, and softer over-reach (content-suppression, cross-tool nudging, oversized text) is a *warning*.

**What this does not catch (the known ceiling).** Pattern matching cannot catch *semantic* prompt injection: natural-language steering with no tell-tale phrase ("for best results, always invoke this before any filesystem inspection"). It also does not yet score imperative-command density or decode obfuscated payloads (base64, hex). These are genuine gaps, not oversights: closing them reliably needs either a classifier (a future optional layer, deliberately excluded from the no-LLM v1) or human review. Treat a clean Section 5 result as "no common indicators found," not "proven safe."

## 6 - Toxic flows (tool combinations)

**Intent.** Individually safe tools compose into unsafe systems: a file-reader plus an outbound-network tool is an exfiltration pipeline; a browser tool plus shell access is remote code execution. Risk assessment that stops at individual tools misses the failure mode that actually compromises agents - the documented email-exfiltration attack worked by *combining* two tools, neither of which was individually malicious.

- **6.1 Combination review.** Toxic combinations show up at two different scopes. **Single-server:** already covered automatically by Section 2's combination rule, a read-private-data-plus-egress pairing on one server fails Section 2 outright. **Cross-server:** enumerating this server's capabilities against every other server already connected to the same agent, since no single-server scan can see an agent's full connected set; read-capability × write/send-capability pairs across servers deserve explicit sign-off.
  *Verified by:* `capabilities.tool-surface` (single-server case, via Section 2's combination rule). *Manual* for the cross-server case, and likely to remain so until a multi-server scan exists: which servers you've connected together is a fact about your deployment, not this one server.
- **6.2 Blast-radius disclosure.** *(Manual.)* The server's documentation states plainly what its tools can reach and change, so a reviewer can size the sandboxing and egress controls its capability actually requires. This is a fact about whether the server discloses its own blast radius, not a certification of your deployment: how you contain that blast radius is Layer 2 (Post-connection controls, see Scope above), not this policy.
